## 2. Core Definition

### WHY: Motivation

Citizens currently face significant difficulty in manually comparing data across different annual budget reports. This project aims to resolve this by establishing a zero-backend-dependency, low-maintenance static web application for visualizing 16 years of central government fiscal data (covering Ma Ying-jeou to Tsai Ing-wen administrations).

### WHAT: Success Criteria

1.  **Zero Backend:** The final website must operate entirely from static files, with no server-side processing.
2.  **Data Accuracy:** All figures must be directly traceable to pre-processed CSVs and adhere to a standardized category mapping.
3.  **Interactivity:** Smooth dynamic playback allowing users to visually grasp the pace of fiscal change.
4.  **Usability:** Intuitive UI for filtering, comparing periods, and understanding the data narrative.

### HOW: Direction

*   **Tech Stack:** React (Frontend structure) + D3.js (Custom visualization).
*   **Data Source:** Static CSV/JSON files pre-processed via Python/Pandas. No dedicated database.
*   **Interactivity:** Utilize React state (`useState`, `useMemo`) for filtering and D3 for transitions.
