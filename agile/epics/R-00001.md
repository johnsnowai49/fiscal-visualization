## 2. Core Goal and Scope Definition

This Epic defines the development of the "Taiwan Fiscal Trend Analysis Platform", a static web application for visualizing central government fiscal data.

### Rationale and Goal (WHY, WHAT, HOW)

* **WHY (Motivation):** Citizens currently face significant difficulty in manually comparing data across different annual budget reports. This project aims to resolve this by establishing a zero-backend-dependency, low-maintenance static web application for visualizing 16 years of central government fiscal data (covering Ma Ying-jeou to Tsai Ing-wen administrations).
* **WHAT (Success Criteria):**
    1.  **Zero Backend:** The final website must operate entirely from static files, with no server-side processing.
    2.  **Data Accuracy:** All figures must be directly traceable to pre-processed CSVs and adhere to a standardized category mapping.
    3.  **Interactivity:** Smooth dynamic playback allowing users to visually grasp the pace of fiscal change.
    4.  **Usability:** Intuitive UI for filtering, comparing periods, and understanding the data narrative.
* **HOW (High-Level Approach):**
    *   **Tech Stack:** React (Frontend structure) + D3.js (Custom visualization).
    *   **Data Source:** Static CSV/JSON files pre-processed via Python/Pandas. No dedicated database.
    *   **Interactivity:** Utilize React state (`useState`, `useMemo`) for filtering and D3 for transitions.

### Out of Scope

*   **Backend Server:** No dedicated backend server or database (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) will be provisioned.
*   **Real-time Data:** The platform uses static historical data; real-time updates are not required.
*   **User Accounts:** No user login or authentication system.

## 4. Task Breakdown and Tracking

### Detailed Task List

#### TASK: [T-00001-001] Data Preparation (Python/Pandas)
* **Description:** Extract, clean, and standardize 16 years of fiscal reports (Excel/ODS) into static CSV/JSON files. Implement normalization mapping for budget item names.

#### TASK: [T-00001-002] Core Development (React Init & Data Loading)
* **Description:** Initialize the React project, set up the basic component structure, and implement the logic to load and parse the static CSV data files using `d3-fetch`.

#### TASK: [T-00001-003] Playback & Visualization (D3.js)
* **Description:** Implement the main Overview chart using D3.js, including the time-based dynamic transition logic (playback) that subscribes to the `currentYear` state.

#### TASK: [T-00001-004] Detailed Pages (Revenue/Expenditure Breakdown)
* **Description:** Develop the specific Revenue and Expenditure pages, utilizing Treemap and Sankey diagrams to visualize the categorical breakdown and flow.

#### TASK: [T-00001-005] Polish & Deployment (Optimization & Static Hosting)
* **Description:** Perform final code review, performance optimization (memoization), and configure the build for deployment to a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages/Vercel).
